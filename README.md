# Vim tip of the day
*The idea is to have a website that shows one and only one vim tip a day.
Learn one thing a day and you will soon be masterful!*

## Todo
* users can add new tips
* get streak for visiting the site many days in a row
* rate tips

## Install and run
* `npm install -g json-server elm`
* `json-server --watch db.json`
* `elm reactor`
* go to `localhost:8000/Main.elm`
* Become a vim wizard
* Profit

### PS
For now it randomizes a tip on refresh but this should be removed.

#### note
one way of adding tips would be to just take in PRs on github.
then host 'vim tip of the day' as a static site.
